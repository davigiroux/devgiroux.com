# Welcome to DevGiroux!

Hello and welcome! I'm excited to share this space with you where we'll explore the fascinating world of web development, programming, and technology.

<Callout type="info">
This blog is built with **Next.js 15**, **MDX**, and **Tailwind CSS**. You can find the source code on GitHub!
</Callout>

## What You'll Find Here

This blog is dedicated to sharing knowledge, insights, and experiences in:

- **Web Development**: Modern frameworks, best practices, and cutting-edge techniques
- **Programming**: Code tutorials, problem-solving approaches, and design patterns
- **Technology**: Latest trends, tools, and innovations in the tech world

## My Approach

I believe in learning by doing and sharing knowledge with the community. Each article aims to be:

1. **Practical** — Real-world examples and use cases you can apply immediately
2. **In-depth** — Thorough explanations without skipping important details
3. **Accessible** — Clear writing for both beginners and experienced developers

<Callout type="tip">
Use the **search feature** (press `Ctrl+K` or `Cmd+K`) to quickly find articles on specific topics!
</Callout>

## A Quick Code Example

Here's a simple React hook that I use in many of my projects:

```typescript
import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function useLocalStorage<T>(key: string, initialValue: T) {
  const [storedValue, setStoredValue] = useState<T>(() => {
    if (typeof window === 'undefined') {
      return initialValue;
    }
    try {
      const item = window.localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : initialValue;
    } catch (error) {
      console.error(error);
      return initialValue;
    }
  });

  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      window.localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(storedValue));
    }
  }, [key, storedValue]);

  return [storedValue, setStoredValue] as const;
}
```

## What's Coming Next?

I'm working on several exciting topics including:

- Modern web development with **Next.js 15** and the App Router
- **TypeScript** best practices and advanced patterns
- Building scalable applications with proper architecture
- Performance optimization techniques for React apps
