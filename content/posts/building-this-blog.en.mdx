# How I Built This Blog with Next.js 15

Building a personal blog is a rite of passage for developers. It's a chance to practice your skills, experiment with new technologies, and create something uniquely yours. In this post, I'll walk you through how I built this blog using modern web technologies.

<Callout type="info">
This is a comprehensive guide covering architecture, design decisions, and implementation details. Use the **Table of Contents** on the right to navigate to specific sections.
</Callout>

## The Tech Stack

Before diving into the implementation, let's look at the technologies powering this blog:

| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Next.js 15 | React framework with App Router |
| MDX | Markdown with JSX components |
| Tailwind CSS v4 | Utility-first styling |
| TypeScript | Type-safe development |
| Shiki | Syntax highlighting |
| Fuse.js | Client-side search |

## Project Structure

The blog follows a well-organized structure that separates concerns clearly:

```bash
├── app/                    # Next.js App Router pages
│   ├── blog/
│   │   ├── [slug]/        # Dynamic blog post pages
│   │   └── page.tsx       # Blog listing
│   ├── tag/[tag]/         # Tag filtered views
│   ├── api/               # API routes
│   └── layout.tsx         # Root layout
├── components/            # React components
│   ├── blog/              # Blog-specific components
│   ├── mdx/               # MDX custom components
│   ├── search/            # Search functionality
│   └── ui/                # Reusable UI components
├── content/posts/         # MDX blog posts
├── lib/                   # Utility functions
└── public/                # Static assets
```

## Content Management with MDX

One of the key decisions was using MDX for content. MDX allows writing Markdown while embedding React components directly in the content.

<Callout type="tip">
MDX combines the simplicity of Markdown with the power of React components. Perfect for technical blogs!
</Callout>

### Frontmatter Schema

Each post includes frontmatter metadata:

```yaml
---
title: "Post Title"
date: "2025-12-30"
description: "A brief description for SEO"
tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
coverImage: "/images/cover.jpg"  # Optional
draft: false                      # Hidden if true
featured: true                    # Shows on homepage
---
```

### Custom Components

I created several custom MDX components to enhance the reading experience:

```tsx
// Callout component for important notes
<Callout type="info">
  This is an informational callout!
</Callout>

// YouTube embed
<YouTubeEmbed videoId="dQw4w9WgXcQ" />

// Code blocks with syntax highlighting
// Powered by Shiki with the GitHub Dark theme
```

## Implementing Search

The search functionality uses Fuse.js for fast, client-side fuzzy searching:

```typescript
import Fuse from 'fuse.js';

const fuse = new Fuse(posts, {
  keys: [
    { name: 'title', weight: 2 },
    { name: 'description', weight: 1.5 },
    { name: 'tags', weight: 1.5 },
    { name: 'content', weight: 1 },
  ],
  threshold: 0.3,
  includeMatches: true,
});
```

The search dialog is triggered with `Ctrl+K` (or `Cmd+K` on Mac), providing a familiar experience for developers.

## Static Generation and SEO

Next.js 15's static generation ensures excellent performance and SEO:

```typescript
// Generate static paths at build time
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const posts = getAllPosts();
  return posts.map((post) => ({ slug: post.slug }));
}

// Generate metadata for each post
export async function generateMetadata({ params }) {
  const post = getPostBySlug(params.slug);
  return {
    title: post.frontmatter.title,
    description: post.frontmatter.description,
    openGraph: {
      type: 'article',
      // ... more metadata
    },
  };
}
```

### SEO Features

The blog includes comprehensive SEO optimization:

- **Dynamic Sitemap** — Automatically includes all posts and tags
- **RSS Feed** — Subscribe at `/feed.xml`
- **Dynamic OG Images** — Generated for each post
- **JSON-LD** — Structured data for rich search results

<Callout type="warning">
Remember to update `lib/config.ts` with your actual site URL before deploying!
</Callout>

## Styling with Tailwind CSS v4

Tailwind CSS v4 brings significant improvements:

```css
/* Electric Violet theme colors */
:root {
  --primary: #8b5cf6;
  --background: #0a0a0f;
  --foreground: #f1f5f9;
}

/* Article content styling */
.article-content {
  font-size: 1.125rem;
  line-height: 1.75;
}
```

The design follows an "Electric Violet" theme with a dark background and purple accents, creating a modern, developer-friendly aesthetic.

## Performance Optimizations

Several optimizations ensure fast load times:

1. **Static Generation** — Pages pre-rendered at build time
2. **Image Optimization** — Next.js automatic image optimization
3. **Code Splitting** — Automatic per-route code splitting
4. **Font Optimization** — Using `next/font` for optimal loading

## Deployment

The blog is designed to deploy seamlessly to Vercel:

```bash
# Push to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Deploy blog"
git push origin main

# Vercel auto-deploys from main branch
```

## What's Next?

Future improvements I'm planning:

- [ ] Add view counters with edge functions
- [ ] Implement newsletter subscription
- [ ] Add related posts suggestions
- [ ] Create a portfolio section

## Conclusion

Building this blog was a great learning experience. Next.js 15 with the App Router provides an excellent foundation for content-focused sites, and MDX makes writing technical content enjoyable.

Feel free to explore the codebase and adapt it for your own projects. Happy coding!
